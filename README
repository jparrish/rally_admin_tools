rally_admin_tools
=====================

The rally_admin_tools kit is a small, simple collection of tools for Rally subscription administrators who need to bulk
create users in their Rally subscription, and provides an easy way to summarize workspaces, projects, and users and their
permissions. All the good ideas for these tools came from:
Rally-User-Management   https://github.com/markwilliams970/Rally-User-Management

rally_admin_tools is similar to Rally-User-Management in the ways listed below:

- Uses the rally_api gem instead of rally_rest_api
- rally_api greatly improves speed and reliability.

rally_admin_tools differs from Rally-User-Management in that it is intended to handle the very specific case of bulk
creating users within a workspace, with EDITOR permissions for every project in that workspace. Other than the
user_definition.csv file, no other intermediate files are generated or required.

rally_admin_tools requires:
- Ruby 1.9.3
- rally_api 0.9.1 or higher
- You can install rally_api and dependent gems by using:
- gem install rally_api
